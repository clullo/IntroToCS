If the value takes up less than the specified width, it is space is padded (by default with the space character). If the value requires more space than alloted, it will take as much space as is require to show the value. So putting a 0 here essentially says \"use as much space as you need.\" The precision is 2, which tells Python to round the value to two decimal places. Finally, the type character f says the value should be displayed as a fixed point number. That means that the specified number decimal places will always be shown, even is they are zero."

The only restricton is that it be distinguishable from actual data values. The sentinel is not processed as part of the data. \n",

    "Sometimes the simple conditions that we have been using do not seen expressive enough.

    "\n",
    "One particularly powerful technique for solving real-world problems is simulation. Computers can model real-world processes to provide otherwise unobtainable information. Computer simulation is used every day to perform myraid tasks such as predicting the weather, designing aircraft, creating special effects for movies, and entertaining video game players, to name just a few. Most of these applications require extremely complex programs, but even relatively modest simulations can shed light on knotty problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we are going to develop a simple simulation of the game of racquetball. Along the way, you will learn some important design and implementation strategies that will help us tackle our own problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "Writing a program to simulate certain aspects of racquetball. Using the simulation, they could let the computer model thousands of games between players of differing skill levels.\n",

    "- Serve\n",
    "- Rally\n",
    "- The player who missed the shot loses the rally\n",
    "- If the loser is the player who served, then service passes to the other player\n",
    "- If the server wins the rally, a point is awarded. \n",
    "- Players can only score point during their own service.\n",
    "- The first player to reach 15 points wins the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our simulation, the ability level of the players will be respresented by the probability that the palyer wins the rally when he or she serves. Thus players with a 0.6 probability win a point on 60% of their serves. \n",

    "The program will prompt the user to enter the service probability for both players and thn simulater multiple games of racquetball using those probabilities. The program will then print a summary of the results.\n",

    "### 9.2. Pseudo Random Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulation program will have to deal with unncertain events. When we say that a player wins50% of the serves, that does not mean that every other serve is a winner. It's more like a coin toss. Overall, we expect that half the time the coin will come up heads and half the time it will come up tails, but there is nothing to prevent a run of five tails in a row. Similarly, our racquetball player should win or lose rallies randomly. The service probability provides a likelihood that a given serve will be won, but the is no set pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many simulations share this property of requiring events to occur witha certain likelihood. A driving simulation must model the unpredictability of other drivers; a bank simulation has to deal with the random arrival of customers. These sorts of simulations are called Monte Carlo algorithms because the results bepend on \"chance\" proabilities. Of course, we know that there is nothing random about computes; they are instruction-following machines. How can computer programsmodel seemingly random happenings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating randomness is a well-studied problem in computer science. A pseudo random number generator works by starting with some seed value. This value is fed to a function to produce a \"random\" number. The next time a random number is needed, the current value is fed back into the function to produce a new number. Witha carefully chosen function, the resulting sequence of values looks essentially random. Of source, if you start the porcess over again with the same seed value, you end up with exactly the same sequence of numbers. It's all determined by the generating function and the value of the seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyhton provides a library module that contains a number of useful functions for generating pseudo random numbers. The functions in this module derive an an intial seed value from the date and time when the module is loaded, so you get a different seed value each time the program is run. This means that you will also get a unique sequence of pseudo random values. The two function of greatest interest to us are randrange and random.\n",

    "The randrange function is used to select a pseudo random int from a given range. It can be used with one, two or three parameters to specify a range exactly as with the range function. For example, randrange(1,6) returns some number from the range [1,2,3,4,5,] and randrange(5,105,5) returns a multiple of 5 between 5 and 100 inclusive. Remember, ranges go up t, but do not include, the stopping value.\n",

    "Our racquetball simulation can make use to the random function to determine whether or not a player wins a serve. Let's look at a specific example. \n",

    "Suppose a player' service probability is 0.70, which means that they should win 70% of their serves. You can imagine a decision in the program something like the:\n",
    "\n",
    "if player wins serve:\n",
    "    score = score + 1\n",

    "Suppose we generate a random value betwee 0 and 1. Exactly 70% of the interval 0...1 is to the left of 0.7. So 70% of the time, the random number will be < 0.7 and it will be >= 0.7 the other 30% of the time. The = goes on the upper end because the random generator can produce a 0 but never a 1. In general, if prob represents the probability that the player wins a serve, the condition random() < prob will succeed with just the right probability.\n",

Eventually, the problems get so small that they are trivial to solve. Then you just put all the pieces back together and you've got a program.\n",

    "##### Top-Level Design\n",

    "\n",
    "In a broad way, this program follows the basic input, process, output pattern. \n",

    "Print an Introduction\n",
    "Get the inputs: probA, probB, n\n",
    "Simulate n games of racquetball using probA and probB\n",
    "\n",
    "Print a report on the wins for playerA and playerB\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's write our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have to print an introduction. It's seems easy so I will finish it later. Here's the start of our program:\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "printIntro()\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move n and get some inputs from the user. This doesn't seem that hard either, we just need to get values for the variables probA, probB and n. The function must return these vauues for the main program to use. \n",

    "Here is what we have so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "printIntro()\n",
    "probA, probB, n = getInputs()\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's move on to the crux of the problem. We need to simulate n games of racquetball using the values probA and probB. Since we don't have any idea on how to do this, let's procrastinate again and push the details off into a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what should we put into main?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call our function simNGames. We need to figure out what the call of this function looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to know how many games to simulate and what the values of probA and probB should be for these simulations. These three values will in a sense, be inputs to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To print out a report you need to know how many games were won by player A and how many games were won by Player B. These must be outputs from the simNGames function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, parameters are use as function inputs and return values serve as function outputs. Given this, we know hwow the next step of the algo should be coded.\n",

    "### 10.2 Example Program: Cannonball\n",
    "\n",
    "Before launching into a detailed discussion of how to write our own classes, let's take a short detour to see how useful classes can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 10.2.1 Program Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to write a program that simulates the flight of a cannonball (or any other projectile such as a bullet, baseball, or shot put). We are particularly interested in finding out how far the cannonball will travel when when fired at various launch angles and initial velocities. The input to the program will be the launch angle (in degrees), the initial velocity (in meters per second) and the initial height (in meters) of the cannonball. The output will be the distance that the projectile travels befores striking the ground (in meters).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we ignore the effects of wind resistance and assume that the cannonballstay's close to earth's surface (i.e., we are not trying to put it into orbit), this is a relatively simple classical physics problem. The acceleration of gravity near the earth's surface is about 9.8 meters per second. That means if an object is thrown upward at a speed of 20 meters per second, after one second has passed, it's upward speed will have slowed to 20 - 9.8 = 10.2 meters per second. After another second, the speed will only be 0.4 meters per second, and shortly after that it will start coming back down.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one knows a little bit of calculus, it's not hard to derive a formula that gives the position of our cannonball at any given moment in its flight. Rather than take the calcuus approach, however, our program will use simulation to track the cannonball moment by moment. Using just a bit of simple trigonometry to get started, along with the obvious relationship that the distance an object travels in a given amount of time is equal to its rate times the amount of time(d=rt), we can solve this algorithmically.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 10.2.2 Designng the Program\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by designing an algo for this problem.\n",
    "We need to consider the flight of the cannonball in two dimensions: height, so we know when it hits the ground; and distance to keep track of how far it goes. We can think of the position of the cannonball as a point (x,y) in a 2D graph where the value of y gives the height above the ground and the value of x gives the distance from the starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulation will have to update the position of the cannonball to account for its flight. Suppose the ball starts at position (0,0) and we want to check its position, say every tenth of a second. In that interval, it will have moved some distance upward (positive y) and some distance forward (positive x). The exact distance in each dimension is determined by its velocity in that direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Separating out the x and y components of the velocity makes the problem easier. Since we are ignoring wind resistance, the x velocity remains constant for the entire flight. However the y velocity changes over time due to the influence of gravity. In fact, the y velocity will start out being positive and then become negative as the cannonball stars back down.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need input statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to calculate the x and y components of the initial velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to consider that our input angle is in degrees and the Python math library uses radian measures. We'll have to convert our angle before applyting the formulas. There are 2pi radians in a circle (360 degrees). This is such a common conversion that the math library provides a convenient function called radians that does this computation. These three formulas give of the code for computing the initial velocities:\n",
    "\n",
    "theta = math.radians(angle)\n",
    "\n",
    "xvel = velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "yvel = velocity * math.cos(theta) * math.sin(theta)\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to the main loop in our program. We want to keep updating the position and velocity of the cannonball until it reached the ground. We can do this by examining the value of ypos.\n",
    "\n",
    "while ypos >= 0.0:\n",
    "\n",
    "We used >= as the relationship so that we can start with the cannonball on the ground (=0) and still get the loop going. The loop will quit as soon as the value of ypos dips just below 0, indicating the cannonball has embedded itself slightly in the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we arrive at the crux of the simulation. Each time we go through the loop, we want to update the state of the cannonball to move it time seconds farther in its flight. Let's start by considering movement in the horizontal direction. Since our specification says that we can ignore wind resistance, the horizontal speed of the cannonball will remain constant and is given by the value of xvel.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example, suppose the ball is traveling at 30 meters per second and is currently 50 meters from the firing point. In another second it will go 30 more meters and be 80 meters from the firing point. If the interval is only 0.1 second, then the cannonball will only fly another 0.1(30) = 3 meters and be at a distance of 53 meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the distance traveled is always given by time * xvel. To updatethe horizontal position, we just need one statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "xpos = xpos + time * xvel\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation for the vertical component is slightly more complicated, since gravity causes the y-velocity to change over time. Each second, yvel must decrease by 9.8 meters per second, the acceleration of gravity. n 0.1 seconds the velocity will decrease by 0.1(9.8) = 0.98 meters per second. The new velocity at the end of the interval is calculated as\n",
    "\n",
    "yvel1 = yvel - time * 9.8\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate how far the cannonball travels during this interval, we need to know its average vertical velocity. Since the acceleration due to gravity is constant, the average velocity will be just the average of the starting and ending velocities (yvel+yvel1)/2.0/ Multiplying this average velocity by the amount of time in the interval gives us the change in height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the completed loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "while yvel >= 0.0:\n",
    "xpos = xpos + time * xvel\n",
    "yvel1 = yvel - time * 9.8\n",
    "ypos = ypos + time * (yvel + yvel1)/2.0\n",
    "yvel = yvel1\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the velocity at the end of the time interval is first store n the temporary variable yvel1. This is done to preserve the initial yvel so that the average velocity can be computed from the two values. Finally, the value of yvel is assigned its new value at the end of the loop. This represents the correct vertical velocity of the cannonball at the end of the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step of our program simply outputs the distance traveled."

    "\n",
    "Using our object-oriented terminology, we create a die by invoking the MSDie constructor and providing the number of sides as a parameter. Our die object will keep track of this number internally using an instance variable. Another instance variable will be used to store the value of the die.

    "\n",
    "Each method definition looks like a normal function definition. Placing the function inside a class makes it a class of that class, rather than a stand-alone function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the three methods defined in this class. You'll notice that each method has a first parameter named self. The first parameter of a method is special-it always contains a reference to the object on which the method is acting. As usual, you can use any name you want for this parameter, but the traditional name is self, so that is what I will always use.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example might be helpful in making sense of self. Suppose we have a main function that executes die1.setValue(8). A method invocation is a function call. Just as in normal function calls, Python executes a four-step sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The calling program(main) suspends at the point of the method application. Python locates the appropriate method definition inside the class of the object to which is being appllied. In this case, contorl is transferring to the setValue method in the MSDie class, since die1 is an instance of MSDie.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The formal paramters of the method get assigned the values supplied by the actual parameters of the call. Inthe case of a method call, the first formal parameter corresponds to the object. In our example, it as is the following assignments are done before executing the method body:\n",
    "\n",
    "self = die1 value = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The body of the method is executed \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Control returns to the point just after where the method was called, in this case, the statement immediately following die1.setValue(8).\n",
    "\n",
    "The self parameter in the definition is a bookeeping detail. Some languages do this implictly; Python requires us to add the extra parameter. To avoid confusion, we will always refer to the first formal parameter of a method as the self parameter and any others as normal parameters. So, I would say setValues uses one normal parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "So self is a parameter that represents an object. But what exactly can we do with it? The main thing to remember is that objects contain their own data. Conceptually, instance variables provide a way to remember data inside an object. Just as with regular variables, instance variables are accessed by name. We can use our familiar dot notation: <object>.<instance-var>. Look at the definition of setValue; self.value refers to the instance variable value that is associated with the object. Each instance of a class has its own instance variables, so each MSDie object has its very own value.\n",
    "    \n",

Of course, they will be the four pieces of information that characterize the flight of the cannonball: xpos, ypos, xvel, yvel. We will calculate these values using the same formulas that were in the original program.\n",

    "    self.yvel = yvel1\n",
    "    \n",
    "Basically, this is the same code that we used in the original program updated to use and modify instance variable. Notice the use of yvel1 as a temporary(ordinary) variable. This new value is saved by storing it into the object in the last line of the method.\n",

    "\n",
    "The projectile example shows how useful a class can be for modeling a rea-world object that has complex behavior. Another common use for objects is simply to group together a set of information that describes a person or thing. For example, A company needs to keep track of information about all of its employees. Their personnel system might make use of an Employee object that contains data such as the employee's name, socil security number, address, salary, department, etc. A grouping of information of this sort is often called a record. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try our hand at some simple data processing involving university students. In a typical university, courses are measured in terms of credit hours and grade point averages are calculated on a 4 point scale where an \"A\" is 4 points, a \"B\" is 3 points, etc. Grade point averages are generally computed using quality points. If a class is worth 3 credit hours and the student gets an \"A\", then he earns 3(4) = 12 quality points. To calculate a student's GPA, we divide the total quality points by the number of credit hours completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have data file that contains student grade information. Each line of the file consists of a student's name, credit-hours and quality points. These three values are separated by a tab character. For example, the contents of the file might loop something like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Our job is to write a program that reads through this file to find the student with the best GPA and print out his/her name, credit-hours and GPA. We can begin by creating a Student class. An object of type Student will be a record of information for a single student. In this case, we have three pieces of information: name, credit-hours and quality points. We can save this information as instance variable that are initialized in the constructor.\n",

    "##### 10.5.1 Encapsulating Useful Abstractions\n",

    "Hopefully, you are seeing how defining new classes like Projectile and Student can be a good way to modularilze a program. Once we identify some useful objects, we can write an algorithm using those objects and push the implementation details into a suitable class definition. This gives us the same kind of separation of concerns that we had using functions in top-down design. The main program only has to worry about what objects can do, not about how they are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer scientists call this separatio of concerns encapsulation. The implementation details of an object are encapsulated in the class definition, which insulates the rest of the program from having to deal with them. This is another application of abstraction (ignoring irrelevant details), which is the essense of good design.\n",
    "\n",
    "For completeness, it should be mentioned that encapsulation is only a programming convention in Python. It is not enforced by the language, per se. In our Projectile class we included two short methods, getX and getY, that simply returned the values of instance variables xpos and ypos, respectively. Our Student class has similar accessor methods for its instance variables. Strictly speaking, these methods are not absolutely necessary. In Python, you can access the instance variable of any object with the regular dot notation. For example, we could test the constructor for the Projectile class interactively by creating an object and then directly inspecting the values of the instance variables."

    "Accessing the instance variables of an object is very handy for testing purposes, but it is generally considered poor practice to do this in programs. One of the main reasons for using objects is to hide the internal complexities of those objects from the programs that use them. References to instance variable should generally remain inside the class definition with the rest of the implementation details. From the outside the class, all interaction with an object should generally be done using the interface provided by its methods. However, this is not a hard and fast rule, and Python program designers often specify that certain instance variable are accessible as part of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "One immediate advantage of encapsulation is that it allows us to modify and improve classes independently, without worrying abour \"breaking\" other parts of the program. As long as the interface provided by a class stays the same, the rest of the program can't even tell that a class has changed. As you begin to design classes of your own, you should strive to provide each with a complete set of methods to make it useful.\n",

    "Often a well-defined class or set of classes provides usefule abstractions that can be leverages in many different programs. For example, we might want to turn our projectile class into its own module file so that it can be used in other programs. In doing so, it would be a good idea to add documentation that describes how the class can be used so that programmers who want to use the module don't have to study the code to figure out (or remember what the class and its methods do.\n",

    "\n",
    "You are already familiar with one way of documenting programs, namely comments. It's always a good idea to provide comments explaining the contents of a module and its uses. In fact, comments of this sort are so important that Python incorporates a special kind of commenting convention called a docstring. You can insert a plain string literal as the first line of a module, class or function to document that component. The advantage of docstrings is that, while ordinary comments are simply ignored by Python, docstrings are actually carried along during execution in a special attribute called __doc__. These strings can be examined dynamically.\n",

    "If you are testing multi-module Python projects interactively, you need to be aware of a subtlety in the Python module importing mechanism. When Python first imports a given module, it creates a module object that conatins all of the things defined in the module(technically, this is called a namespace). If a module imports successfully (it has no syntax errors), subsequent imports do not reload the module, they just create additional references to the exisiting module object. Even if a module has been changed (its source file edited) reimporting it into an ongoing interactive session will not get you an updated version.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to interactively replace a module object using the function reload(module) in the imp module of the standard library (consult the Python documentation for details). But often this won't give you the results you want. That's because reloading a module doesn't change the values of any identifiers in the current session that already refer to objects from the old version of the module. In fact, it's pretty easy to create a situation where objects from both the old and new verision of a module are active at the same time, which is confusing to say the least.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to avoid this confusion is to make sure you start a new interactive session for testing each time any of the modules involved in your tests is modified. That way you are guaranteed to get a fresh (updated) import of all the modules that you are using.\n",

    "#### 10.6 Widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "One very common use of objects is in the design of graphical user interfaces(GUIs). Back in Chapter 4, we talked about GUIs being composed of visual interface objects called widgets. The Entry object defined in our graphics library is one example of a widget. Now that we know how to define new classes, we can create our own custom widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 10.6.1 Examle Program: Dice Roller\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try our hand at building a couple of useful widgets. As an example application, consider a program that rolls a pair of standard(six-sided)dice. The program will display the dice graphically and provide two buttons, one for rolling the dice and one for quitting the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program has two kinds of widgets: buttons and dice. We can start by developing suitable classes. The two buttons will be instances of a Button class, and the class that provides a graphical view of the value of a die will be DieView.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 10.6.2 Building Buttons\n",
    "\n",
    "Buttons, of course, are standard elements of virtually every GUI these days. Modern buttons are very sophisticated, usually having a 3-dimensional look and feel. Our simple graphics package doesn't have the machinery to produce buttons that appear to depress as they are clicked. The best we can do is find out where the mouse was clicked after the click has already completed. Nevertheless, we can make a useful, if less pretty, button class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our buttons will be rectangular regions in a graphics window where user clicks can influence the behavior of the running application. We will need to create buttons and determine when they have been clicked. In addition, it is also nice to be able to activate and deactivate individual buttons. That way, our applications can signal which options are available to the user at any given moment. Typically, an inactive button is grayed-out to show that it is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing this description, our buttons will support the following methods:constructor Create a button in a window. We will have to specify the window in which the button will be displayed, the location/size of the button, and the label that will be on the button.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "activate - Set the state of the button to active\n",
    "\n",
    "deactivate - Set the state of the button to inactive\n",
    "\n",
    "clicked - Indicate if the button was clicked. If the button is active, this method will determine if the point clicked is inside the button region. The point will have to be sent as a parameter to the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "getLabel - Returns the label string of the button. This is provided so that we can identify a particular button.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to support these operations, our buttons will need a number of instance variables. For example, the button itself will be drawn as a rectangle with some text centered in it. Invoking the activate and deactivate methods will change the appearance of the button. Saving the Rectangle and Text objects as instance variable will allow us to change the width of the outline and the color of the label. We might start by implementing the various methods to see what other instance variables might be needed. Once we have identified the relevant variables, we can write a constructor that initializes these values.\n",
    "\n",

First, in the constructor, I have defined a set of values that determine various aspects of the die such as its color and the size of the pips. Calculating these values in the constuctor and then using them in other places allows us to easily tweak the appearance of the die without having to search through the code to find all the places where those values are used. I actually figured out the specific calculations (such as the pip size being one-tenth of the die size) through a process of trial and error. \n",

Inside the constructor, it is invoked by lines such as self.__makePip(cx,cy).

The median is the value that splits the data set into equal sized parts. For the data 2,4,6,9,13, the median value is 6, since there are two values greater than six and two that are smaller. One way to calculate the median is to store all the numbers and put them in order so that we can identify the middle value.\n",

    "\n",
    "As you know, Python lasts are ordered sequences of items. In fact, the ideas and notations that we use for manipulating lists are borrowed from the mathematical notion of sequence. Mathematicians sometimes give an entire sequence of items a single name. For instance, a sequence of n numbers might just be called S.\n",

    "By using numbers as subscripts, mathematicians are able to succintly summarize computations over items in the sequence using subscript variables.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose that our sequence is stored in a variable called s. We could write a loop to calculate the sum of the items in the sequence like this:\n",

    "sum = sum + s[i]\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtually all computer languages provide some sort of sequence structure similar to Python's list; in other languages, it is called an array. To summarize, a list is a sequence of items where the entire sequence is referred to by a single name (in this case, s) and individual items can be selected by indexing (e.g., s[i]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays in other programming languages are generally fixed size. When you create an array, you have to specify how many items it will hold. If you don't know how many items you will have then you have to allocate a large array, just in case, and keep track of how many \"slots\" you actually fill. Arrays are also usually homogeneous. That means they are restricte to holding objects of a single data type. You can have an array of ints or an array of strings but cannot mix strings and ints in a single array. \n",

    "#### 11.4 Designing with Lists and Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and classes taken together give us powerful tools for structuring the data in our programs. Let's put these tools to work in some more sophisticated examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the DieView class from the last chapter? In order to display the six possible values of a die, each DieView object keeps track of seven circles representing the position of pips on the face of a die. In the previous version, we saved the circles using instance variables, pip1, pip2, pip3, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider how the code looks using a collection of circle objects stored as a list. The basic idea is to repace our seven instance variables witha single list called pips. Our first problem is to create a suitable list. This will be done in the constructor for the DieView class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous version, the pips were created with this sequence of statements inside of __init__:\n",
    "              \n",
    "Recall that __makePip is a local method of the DieView class that creates a circle centered at the position given by its parameters. We want to replace these lines with code to create a list of pips. One approach would be to start with an empty list of pips and build up the final list one pip at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "An even more straightforward approach is to create the list directly, enclosing the calls to __makePip inside list construction brackets, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "self.pips = [ self.__makePip(cx-offset, cy-offset),\n",
    "              self.__makePip(cx-offset, cy),\n",
    "              self.__makePip(cx-offset, cy+offset),\n",
    "              self.__makePip(cx, cy),\n",
    "              self.__makePip(cx+offset, cy-offset),\n",
    "              self.__makePip(cx+offset, cy),\n",
    "              self.__makePip(cx+offset, cy+offset) ]\n",
    "              \n",
    "Notice how we formatted this statement element on each line. Again, Python is smart enough to know that the end of the statement has not been reached until it finds the matching square bracket. Listing complex objects one per line like this makes it much easier to see what is happening. Just make sure to include commas at the end of the intermediate lines to separate the items of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of a pip list is that it is much easier to perform actions on the entire set. For example, we can blank out the die by setiing all of the pips to have the same background color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than making one giant line, I put one list:\n",
    "\n",
    "for pip in self.pips:\n",
    "    pips.setFill(self.background)\n",
    "    \n",
    "See how these two lines of code loop through the entire collection of pips to change their color? This required required seven lines of code in the previous version using separate instance variables. Similarly, we can turn a set of pips back on by indexing the appropriate spot in the pips list. In the original program, pips 1, 4 and 7 were turned on for the value 3. \n",

    "self.pip1.setFill(self.foreground)\n",
    "self.pip4.setFill(self.foreground)\n",

    "In the new version, this corresponds to pips in positions 0, 3, and 6, since the pips list is indexed starting at 0. A parallel approach could accomplish the task with these three lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "self.pips[0].setFill(self.foreground)\n",
    "self.pips[3].setFill(self.foreground)\n",
    "self.pips[6].setFill(self.foreground)\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing it this way makes explicit the correspondence between the individual instance variables used in the first version and the list elements used in the second version. By subscripting the list, we can get at the individual pip objects, just as if they were separate variables. However, this code does not really take advantage of the new representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an easier way to turn on the same three pips:\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in [0,3,6]:\n",
    "    self.pips[i].setFill(self.foreground)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Using an index variable in a loop, we can turn all three pips on using the same line of code. The second approach considerably shortens the code needed in the setValue method of the DieView class. We could implement this algo using a multi-way selection followed by a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "for pip in self.pips:\n",

    "\n",
    "This version without lists requires 36 lines of code to accomplsh the same task. But we can do even better than this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this code still uses the if-elif structure to determine which pips should be turned on. The correct list of indexes is determined by value; we can make this decision table-driven instead. The idea is to use a list where each item in the list is itself a list of pip indexes. For example, the item in position 3 should be the list [0,3,6], since these are the pips that must be turned on to show a value of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how a table-driven approach can be coded:\n",
    "\n",
    "onTable = [ [], [3], [2,4], [2,3,4], [0,2,4,6], [0,2,3,4,6],\n",
    " [0,1,2,4,5,6] ]\n",

    "for pip in self.pips:\n",
    "self.pip.setFill(self.background)\n",
    "on = onTable[value]\n",
    "for i in on:\n",
    "self.pips[i].setFill(self.foreground)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have called the table of pip indexes onTable. Notice that I padded the table by placing an empty list in the first position. If value is 0, the DieView will be blank. Now we have reduced our 36 lines of code to seven. In addition, this version is much easier to modify, if you want to change which pips are displayed for various values, you simply modify the entries in onTable.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one last issue to address. The onTable will remain unchanged throughout the life of any particular DieView. Rather than (re)creating this table each time a new value is displayed, it would be better to create the table in the constructor and save it in an instance variable. Putting the definition of onTable into __init__yields this nicely completed class:\n",

    "Study this code carefully. A button is normally specified by providing a center point, width, height and label.

Rather than creating the buttons directly, this code first creates a list of button specifications, bSpecs. This list of specifications is then used to create the buttons. \n",

A tuple looks like a list except that it is enclosed in round parantheses () instead of square brackets []. A tuple is just another kind of sequence in Python. Tuples are like lists except that tuples are immutable - the items can't be changed. If the contents of a sequence won't be changes after it is created, using a tuple is more efficient than using a list.\n",

We can use a loop that iterates through each word in the document and adds one to the appropriate count.

The first time we encounter a word, it will not yet be in counts. Attempting to access a non-existent key produces a run-time KeyError. To guard against this, we need a decision in our algorithm.\n",

    "## Object-Oriented Design\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.1 The Process of OOD\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we kow some data structuring techniques, it's time to stretch our wings and put those tools to work. Most modern computer applications are designed using a data-centered view of computing. This so-called object-oriented design (OOD) process is a powerful complement to top-down design for the development of reliable, cost-effective software systems. In this chapter, we will look at the basic principles of OOD and apply them in a couple of case studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of design is descibing a system in terms of magical black boxes and their interfaces. Each component provides a set of services through its interface. Other components are users or clients of the services.\n",
    "\n",
    "A client only needs to understand the interface of a service; the details of how that service is implemented are not important. In fact, the internal details may change radically and not affect the client at all. Similarly, the component providing the service does not have to consider how the service might be used. The black box just has to make sure that the service is faithfully delivered. This separation of concerns is what makes the design of complex systems possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In top-down design, functions serve the role of our maginal black boxes. A client program can use a function as along as it understands what the function does. The details of how the task is accomplished are encapsulated in the function defintion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented design, the black boxes are objects. The magic behind objects lies in class defintions. Once a suitable class defintion has been written, we can completely ignore how the class works and just rely on the external interface; the methods. This is what allows us to draw circles in the graphics windows without so much as a glance at the code in the graphics module. All the nitty-gritty details are encapsulated in the class definitions for GraphWin and Circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can break a large problem into a set of cooperating classes, we drastically reduce the complexity that must be considered to understand any given part of the program. Each class stands on its own. Object-oriented design is the process of finding and defining a useful set of classes for a given problem. Like all design, it is part art an part science.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different approaches to OOD, each with its own special techniques, notations, gurus and textbooks. The best way to learn about OOD is by doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, here are some intuitive guidelines for OOD.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look for object candidates. \n",
    "Our goal is to define a set of objects that will be helpful in solving the problem. Start with a careful consideration of the problem statement. Objects are usually described by nouns. You might underline all of the nouns in the problem statement and consider them one by one. Which of them will actually be represented in the program? Which of the have \"interesting\" behavior? Things that can be represented as primitive data types (numbers or strings) are probably not important candidates for objects. Things that seem to involve a grouping of related data items (e.g., coordinates of a point or personal data about an employee) probably are.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identify instance variables. \n",
    "Once you have uncovered some possible objects, think about the information atht each object will need to do its job. What linds of values will the instance variables have? Some object attributes will have primitive values; others might themselves be complex types that suggest other useful objects/classes. Strive to find good \"home\" classes for all the data in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Think about interfaces.\n",
    "When you have identifies a potential object/class and some associated data, think about what operations would be required for objects of that class to be useful. You might start by considering the verbs in the problem statement. Verbs are used to descibe actions; what must be done. List the methods that the class will require. Remember that all manipulation of the object's data should be done through the methods you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Refine the nontrivial methods.\n",
    "Some methods will look like they can be accomplished with a couple of lines of code. Other methods will require considerable work to develop an algo. Use top-down design and stepwise refinement to flesh out the details of the more difficult methods. As you go along, you may very well discover that some new interactions with other classes are needed, and this may force you to add new methods to other classes. Sometimes you may discover a need for a brand new kind of object that calls for the definition of another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Design iteratively.\n",
    "As you work through the design, you will bounce back and forth bewteen designing new classes and adding methods to existing classes. Work on whatever seems to be demanding your attention. No one designs a program top to bottom in a linear, systematic fashion. Make progress whenever it seems progress needs to be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Try out alternatives\n",
    "Don't be afraid to scrap an approach the doesn't seem to be working or to follow an idea and see where it leads. Good design involves a lot of trial and error. When you look at the programs of others, you are seeing finished work, not the process they went through to get there. If a program is well designed, it is probably not the result of a first try. Fred brooks, a legendary software engineer, said \"Plan to throw one away.\" Often you won't really know how a system should be built until you've already built it the wrong way.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Keep it simple\n",
    "At each step in the design, try to find the simplest approach that will solve the problem at hand. Don't design in extra complexity until it is clear that a more complex approach is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll walk through a couple of case studies that illustrate aspects of OOD. Once we fully understand these examples, we will be able to tackle our own programs and refine our design skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.2 Case Study: Racquetball Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to the racquetball simulation from Chapter 9. The crux of the problem is to simulate multiple games of racquetball where the ability of the two opponents is represented by the probability that they win a point when they are serving. The inputs to the simulation are the probability for player A, the probability for player B and the number of games to simulate. The output is a nicely formatted summary of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original version of the program, we ended a game when one of the payers reached a total of 15 points. This time around, let's also consider shutouts. If one player gets to 7 before the other player has scores a point, the game ends. Our simulation should keep track of both the number of wins for each player and the number of wins that are shutouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 12.2.1 Candidate Objects and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task is to find a set of objects that could be usefule in solving this problem. We need to simulate a series of racquetball games between two players and record some statistics about the series of games. This short description already suggests one way of dividing up the work in the program. We need to do two basic things: simulate a game and keep track of some statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's tackle simulation of the game first. We can use an object to represent a single game of racquetball. A game will have to keep track of information about two players. When we creat a new game, we will specify the skill levels of the players. This suggests a class, let's call it RBallGame, with a constructor that requires parameters for the probabilities of the two players. \n",
    "\n",
    "What does our program need to do with a game? Of course it needs to play it. Let's give our class a play method that simulates the game until it is over. We could create and play a racquetball game with two lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "theGame = RBallGame(probA, probB)\n",
    "theGame.play()\n",
    "\n",
    "To play lots of games, we just need to put a loop around this code. That's all we really need in RBallGame to write the main program. Let's turn our attention to collecting statistics about the games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, we will have to keep track of at least four counts in order to print a summary of our simulations: wins for A, wins for B, shououts for A, and shutouts for B. We will alos print out the number of games simulated, but this can be calculated by adding the wins for A and B. Here we have four related pieces of information. Rather than treating them independently, let's group them into a single object. This object will be an instance of a class called SimStats.\n",
    "\n",
    "A SimStats object will keep track of all the information about a series of games. We have already analyzed the four crucial pieces of information. Now we have to decide what operations will be useful. For starters, we need a constructor that initializes all of the counts to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need a way of updating the counts as each new game is simulated. Let's give our object an update method. The update of the statistics will be basedon the outcome of a game. We will have to send some information to the statistics object so that the update can be done appropriately. An easy approach would be to just end the entire game and let update extract whatever information it needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when all of the games have been simulated, wee need to print out a report of the results. This suggests a printReport method that prints out a nice report of the accumulated statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now done enough design tha we can actually write the main function for our program. Most of the details have been pushed off into the definition of our two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "printIntro()\n",
    "probA, probB, n = getInputs()\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, play the games\n",
    "stats = SimStats()\n",
    "for i in range(n):\n",
    "    theGame = RBallGame(probA, probB) # create a new game\n",
    "    theGame.play() # play it\n",
    "    stats.update(theGame) # get info about completed game\n",
    "    stats.printReport()  # Print the results\n",
    "    \n",
    "We have also used a couple helper functions to print an introduction and get the inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's flesh out the details of our two classes. The SimStats class looks pretty easy; we'll tackle that one first.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 12.2.2 Implementing SimStats\n",
    "The constructor for SimStats just needs to initialize the four counts to 0. Here is an obvious approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "class SimStats:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "    self.winsA = 0\n",
    "    self.winsB = 0\n",
    "    self.shutsA = 0\n",
    "    self.shutsB = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now let's take a look at the update method. It takes a game as a normal parameter and must update the four counts accordingly. The heading of the method will look like this:\n",
    "def update(self, aGame):\n",
    "\n",
    "But how exactly do we know what to do? We need to know the final score of the game, but this information resides inside of aGame. Remember, we are not allowed to directly access the instance variables of aGame. We don't even know yet what those variable will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis suggests the need for a new method in the RBallGame class. We need to extend the interface so that aGame has a way of reporting the final score. Let's call the new method getScores and have it return the score for player A and the score for player B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the algo for update is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "def update(self, aGame):\n",
    "    a, b = aGame.getScores()\n",
    "    if a > b: # A won the game\n",
    "    \n",
    "    self.winsA = self.winsA + 1\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        self.shutsA = self.shutsA + 1\n",
    "    else: # B won the game\n",
    "        self.winsB = self.winsB + 1\n",
    "    if a == 0:\n",
    "        self.shutsB = self.shutsB + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "We can complete the simStats class by writing a methos to print out the results. Our printReport method will generate a table that shows the wins, wn percentage, shutouts, and shutout percentage for each player.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy to print out the headings for this table but the formatting of the lines takes a little more care. We want to get the colums lined up nicely, and we must avoid division by zero in calculating the shutout percentage for a player who didn't get any wins. Let's write the basic method but procrastinate a bit and push off the details of formatting the line into another methos, printLine. The printLine method will need the player label (A or B) number of wins and shutouts, and the total number of games (for calculation of percentages).\n",
    "\n",
    "def printReport(self):\n",
    "    . # Print a nicely formatted report\n",
    "    n = self.winsA + self.winsB\n",
    "    print(\"Summary of\", n , \"games:\\n\")\n",
    "    print(\" wins (% total) shutouts (% wins) \")\n",
    "    print(\"------------------------------------\")\n",
    "    self.printLine(\"A\", self.prntLine(\"B\", self.winsA, self.winsB, self.shutsA, n) self.shutsB, n)\n",
    "    \n",
    "To finish out the class, we implement the printLine method. This method will make heavy use of string formatting. A good start is to define a template for the information that will appear in each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "def printLine(self, label, wins, shuts, n):\n",
    "    template = \"Player {0}:{1:5} ({2:5.1%}) {3:11} ({4})\n",
    "    if wins == 0: # Avoid division by zero!\n",
    "        shutStr = \"------\"\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        shutStr = \"{0:4.1%}.format(float(shuts)/wins)\n",
    "        print(template.format(label, wins, float(wins)/n, shuts, shutStr))\n",
    "        \n",
    "Notice how the shutout percentage is handled. the main template includes it as a fifth slot and the if statement takes care of formatting this piec to prevent division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 12.2.3 Implementing RBallGame\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have wrapped up the SimStats class, we need to turn our attention to RBallGame. Summarizing what we have decided so far, this class needs a constructor that accepts two probabilities as parameters, a play method that plays the game, and a getScores method that reports the scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "What will a racquetball game need to know? To actually play the game, we have to remember the probability for each player, the score for each player and which player is serving. If you think about this carefully, you will see that probability and score are properties related to particular players, while the server is a property of the game bewteen two players. that suggests that we might simply consider that a game needs to know who the players are and which is serving. The players themselves can be objects that know their probability and score. Thinking about the RballGame class this way leads us to design some new objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the players are objects, then we will need another class to define their behavior. Let's name that class Player. A Player object will keep track of its proability and current score. When a Player is first created the probability will be supplied as a parameter, but the score will just start out at 0. We'll flesh out the design of Player class methoods as we work on RballGame.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now in a position to define the constructor for RBallGame. The game will need instance variables for the two players and another variable to keep track of which player is serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "class RBallGame:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, self.playerA = self.playerB = probA, probB):\n",
    "        Player(probA) \n",
    "        Player(probB)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        self.server = self.PlayerA # player A always serves first\n",
    "        \n",
    "Sometimes it helps to draw a picture to see the realtionships among the objects that we are creating. Suppose we creat an instance of RBallGame like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "theGame = RBallGame(.6, .5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, now that we can create an RBallGame, we need to figure out how to play it. We need an algo that continues to seve rallies and either award points or change the server as appropriate until the game is over. We can translate this loose algorithm almost directly into our object-based code.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need a loop that continues as long as the game is not over. Obviously, the decision of whether the game has ended or not can only be made by looking at the game object itself. Let's just assume that an appropriate isOvermethod can be written. The beginning of our play methos can make use of this (yet to be written) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "def play(self):\n",

    "Based on this result, we either award a point or change the server. To award a point, we need to change a player's score. This again requires the player to do something, namely increment the score. Changing servers, on the other hand, is done at the game level, since this information is keft in the server instance variable of RBallGame.\n",

    "Before attacking these new methods, let's go back and finish up the other top-level method of the RBallGame class, namely getScores. This one just returns the scores of the two players.

    "### 12.3 Case Study: Dice Poker\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 10, we suggested that objects are particularly useful for the design of graphical user interfaces (GUI). Let's look at a graphical application using some of the widgets that we developed in previous chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 12.3.1 Program Specification \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to write a game program that allows a user to play video poker using dice. The program will display a hand consisting of five dice. The basic set of rules is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The player starts with $100\n",
    "Each round costs $10 to play. This amount is subtracted from the palyer's money at the start of the round.\n",
    "The player initially rolls a completely random hand (i.e., all five dice are rolled).\n",
    "The player gets two chances to enhance the hand by rerolling some or all of the dice.\n",
    "At the end of the hand, the player's money is updated according to the following payout schedule:\n",
    "Hand Pay\n",
    "Two Pairs 5\n",
    "Three of a Kind 8\n",
    "Full House (A pair and Three of a Kind) 12\n",
    "Four of a Kind 15\n",
    "Straight (1-5 or 2-6) 20\n",
    "Five of a Kind 30\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we want this program to present a nice graphical interface. Our interaction will be through mouse clicks. The interface should have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "The current score (amount of money) is constantly displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program automatically terminates if the player goes broke.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player may choose to quit at appropriate points during play.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface will present visual cues to indicate what is going on at any given moment and what the valid user responses are.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 12.3.2 Identifying Candidate Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "our first step is to analyze the program description and identify some objects that will be useful in attacking this problem. This is a game involving dice and money. Are either of these good candidates for objects? Both the money and an individual die can be simply represented as numbers. By themselves, they do not to seem to be good objects candidates. However, the game uses five dice and this sounds like a collection. We will still need to be able to roll all the dice or a selection of dice as well as analyze the collection to see what it scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can encapsulate the informatio abut the dice in a Dice class. Here are a few obvious operations that this class will have to implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "constuctor - Create the initial collection\n",
    "\n",
    "rollAll - Assign random values to each of the five dice\n",
    "\n",
    "roll - Assign a random value to some subset of the dice, while maintaining the current value of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "values - Return the current values of the five dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "score - Return the score for the dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also think of the entire program as an object. Let's call the class PokerApp. A PokerApp object will keep track of the current amount of money, the dice, the number of rolls, etc. It will implement a run method that we use to get things started and also some helper methods that are used to implement run. We won't know exactly what methods are needed until we design the main algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, I have concentrated on the actual game that we are implementing. Another component to this program will be the user interface. One good way to break down the complexity of a more sophisticated program is to separate the user interface from the main guts of the program. This is often called the model-view approach. Our program implements some model (in this case, it models a poker game), and the interface is a view of the current state of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of separating out the interface is to encapsulate the decisions about the interface in a separate interface object. An advantage of this approach is that we can change the look and feel of the program simply by substituting a different interface object. For example, we might have a text-based version of a program and a graphical version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that our program will make use of an interface object, call it a PokerInterface. It's not clear yet exactly what behaviors we will need from this class, but as we refine the PokerApll class, we will need to get information from the user and also display infomration about the game. These will correspond to method implemented by the PokerInterface class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 12.3.3 Implementing the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have a pretty good picture of what the Dice class will do and a starting point for implementing the PokerApp class. We could proceed by working on either of these classes. We won't really be able to try out the Poker App class until we have dice so let's start with the lower-level Dice class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implementing Dice\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dice class implements a collection of dice, which are just changing numbers. The obvious representation is to use a list of five ints. Our constructor needs to create a list and assign some intitial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dice:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.dice = [0]*5\n",
    "        self.rollAll()\n",
    "        \n",
    "This code first creates a list of five zeroes. These need to be set to some random values. Since we are going to implement a rollAll function anyway, calling it here saves duplicating that code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need methods to selected dice and also to roll all of the dice. Since the latter is a special case of the former, let's turn our atteention to the roll function, which rolls a subset. We can specifiy which dice to roll by passing a list of indexes. For example, roll([0,3,4]) would roll the dice in positions 0,3 and 4 of the dice list. We just need a loop that goes through the paramter and generates a new random value for each listed position.\n",
    "\n",
    "def roll(self, which):\n",
    "    for pos in which:\n",
    "        self.dice[pos] = randrange(1,7)\n",
    "        \n",
    "Next, we can use roll to implement rollAll as follows:\n",
    "def rollAll(self):\n",
    "    self.roll(range(5))\n",
    "    \n",
    "We used range(5) to generate a sequence of all the indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values function is used to return the values of the dice so that they can be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another one-liner suffices.\n",
    "\n",
    "def values(self):\n",
    "    return self.dice[:]\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice that we created a copy of the dice list by slicing it. That way, if a Dice client modifies the list that it gets back from values, if will not affect the original copy stored in the Dice object. This defensive programming prevents other parts of the code from accidentall messing with our object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we come to the score method. This si the function that will determine the worth of the current dice. We need to examine the values and determine whether we have any of the pattenrs that lead to a payoff, namelyFive of a Kind, Four of a Kind, Full House, Three of a Kind, Two Pairs, or Straight. Our function will need some way toindicate what the payoff is. Let's return a string labeling what the hand is and an int that gives the payoff amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of this function as a multi-way decision. We simply need to check for each possible hand. If we do so in a sensible order, we can guarrantee giving the correct payout. For example, a full house also contains a three of a kind. We need to check for the full ouse before checking for three of a kind, since the full house is more valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple way of checking the hand is to generate a list of the counts of each value. That is, counts[i] will be the number of times that the i occurs in dice. If the dice are: [3,2,5,2,3] then the count list would be [0,0,2,2,0,1,0]. Notice thath counts [0] will always be zero, since dice values are in the range 1-6. Checking for various hands can then be done by looking for various values in counts. For example, if counts contains a 3 and a 2, the hand contains a triple and a pair; hence it is a full house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "def score(self):\n",
    "    . # Create the counts list\n",
    "    counts = [0] * 7\n",
    "    for value in self.dice:\n",
    "        counts[value] = counts[value] + 1\n",
    "        . # score the hand\n",
    "        if 5 in counts:\n",
    "            return \"Five of a Kind\", 30\n",
    "        elif 4 in counts:\n",
    "            return \"Four of a Kind\", 15\n",
    "        elif (3 in counts) and (2 in counts):\n",
    "            return \"Full House\", 12\n",
    "        elif 3 in counts:\n",
    "            return \"Three of a Kind\", 8\n",
    "        elif not (2 in counts) and (counts[1]==0 or counts[6] == 0):\n",
    "            return \"Straight\", 20\n",
    "        elif counts.count(2) == 2:\n",
    "            return \"Two Pairs\", 5\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return \"Garbage\", 0\n",

    "##### Implementing PokerApp\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to turn our attention to the task of actually implementing the poker game. We can use top-down design to flesh out the details and also suggest what methods will have to be implemented in the PokerInterface class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we know that the PokerApp will need to keep track of the dice, the amount of money, and some user interface. Let's initialize these values use in the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "class PokerApp:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.dice = Dice()\n",
    "        self.money = 100\n",
    "        self.interface = PokerInterface()\n",
    "        \n",
    "To run the program, we will create an instance of this class and call its run method. Basically, the program will loop, allowing the user to continue playing hands until he or she is either out of money or chooses to quit. Since it costs $10 to play a hand, we can continue as long as self.money >= 10. Determining whether the user actually wants to play anothe hand must come from the user interface. Here is one way we might code the run method:\n",
    "\n",
    "def run(self):\n",
    "    while self.money >= and self.interface.wantToPlay():\n",
    "        self.playRound()\n",
    "        self.interface.close()\n",
    "        \n",
    "Notice the call to interface.close at the bottom. This will allow us to do any necessary cleaning up such as printing a final message for the user or closing a graphics window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the work of the program has now been pushed into the playRound method. Let's continue the top-down process by focusing our attention here. Each round will consist of a series of rolls. Based on these rolls, the program will have to adjust the player's score.\n",
    "\n",
    "def playRound(self):\n",
    "    self.money = self.money - 10\n",
    "    self.interface.setMoney(self.money)\n",
    "    self.doRolls()\n",
    "    result, score = self.dice.score()\n",
    "    self.interface.showResult(result, score)\n",
    "    self.money = self.money + score\n",
    "    self.interface.setMoney(self.money)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This code only really handles the scoring aspect of a round. Anytime new information must be shown to the user, a suitable method from interface is invoked. The $10 fee to play a round is first deducted and the interface is updated with the new amount of money remaining. The program then processes a series of rolls(doRolls), show the user the result, and updates the amount of money accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we are down to the nitty-gritty details of implementing the dice rolling process. Initially, all of the dice will be rolled. Them we need a loop that continues rolling user-selected dice until either the user chooses to quit rolling or the limit of three rolls is reached. Let's use a local variable rolls to kepp track of how many times the dice have been rolled. Obviously, displaying the dice and getting the list of dice to roll must come from interaction with the user through interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "def doRolls(self):\n",
    "    self.dice.rollAll()\n",
    "    roll = 1\n",
    "    self.interface.setDice(self.dice.values())\n",
    "    toRoll = self.interface.chooseDice()\n",

    "    if roll < 3:\n",
    "        toRoll = self.interface.chooseDice()\n",
    "        \n",
    "At this point, we have completed the basic functions of our interactive poker program. That is, we have a model of the process for playing poker. We can't really test out this program yet, however, because we don't have a user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 12.3.4 A Text-Based UI\n",
    "\n",
    "In designing PokerApp we have also developed a specification for a generic PokerInterface class. Our interface must support the methods for displaying information: setMoney, setDice, and showResult. It must also have methods that allow for input from the user: wantToPlay and chooseDice. These methods can be implemented in many different ways, producing programs that look quite different even though the underlying model, PokerApp, remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, graphical interfaces are much more complicated to design and build than text-based ones. If we are in a hurry to get our application running, we might first try building a simple text-based interface. We can use this for testing an debugging of the model without all the extra complication of a full-blown GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's tweak our PokerApp class a bit so that the user interface is supplied as a parameter to the constructor.\n",

    "    self.dice = Dice()\n",
    "    self.money = 100\n",
    "    self.interface = interface\n",
    "    \n",
    "Then we can easily create versions of the poker programm using different interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider a bare-bones interface to test out the poker program. Our text-based version will not present a finished application, but rather, it provides a minimalist interface solely to get the program running. Each of the necessary methods can be given a trivial implementation.\n",

    "##### 12.3.5 Developing a GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a working program, let's turn our attention to a graphical interface. Our first step must be to decide exactly how we want our interface to look an function. The interface will have to support the various methods found in the text-based version and will also probably have some additional helper methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Designing the Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the basic methods that must be supported and decide exactly how interaction with the user will occur. Clearly, in a graphical interface, the faces of the dice and the current score should be continuously displayed. The setDice and setMoney methods will be used to change those displays. That leaves one output method, showResult, that we need to accomodate. One common way to handle this sort of transient information is with a message at the bottom of the window. This is sometomes called a status bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get information from the user, we will make use of buttons. In wantToPlay, the user will have to decide between either rolling the dice or quitting. We could include \"Roll Dice\" and \"Quit\" buttons for this choice. That leaves us with figuring out how the user should choose dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement chooseDice, we could provide a button for each die and have the user click the buttons for the dice they want to roll. When the user is done choosing the dice, they could click the \"Roll Dice\" button again to roll the selected dice. Elaborating on this idea, it would be nice if we allowed the user to change his or her mind while selecting the dice. Perhaps clicking the button of a currently selected die would cause it to become unselected. The clicking of the button will serve as a sortof toggle that selects/unselects a particular die. The user commits to a certain selection by clicking on \"Roll Dice.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Our vision for chooseDice suggests a couple of tweaks for the interface. First, we should have some way of showing the user which dice are currently selected. There are lots of ways we could do this. One simple approach would be to change the color of the die. Let's \"gray out\" the pips on the dice selected for rolling. Second, we need a good way for the user to indicate that they wish to stop rolling. That is, they would like the dice scored just as they stand. We could handle this by having them click the \"Roll Dice\" button when no dice are selected, hence asking the program to roll no dice. Another approach would be to provide a separate button to click that causes the dice to be scored. The latter approach seems a bit more intuitive/informative. Let's add a \"Score\" button to the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "No we have a basic idea of how the interface will function. We still need to figure out how it will look. What is the exact layout of the widgets?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Managing the Widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "The graphical interface that we are developing makes use of buttons and dice. Our intent is to reuse the Button and DieView classes for these widgets that we developed earlier. The Button class can be used as is, and since we have quite a number of buttons to manage, we can use a list of Buttons, similar to the approach we used in the calculator prgram from Chapter 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the buttons in the calculator program, the buttons of our poker interface will not be active all of the tie. For example, the dice buttons will only be active when the user is actually in the process of choosing dice. When user input is required, the valid buttons for that interaction will be set active and the others will be inactive. To implement this behavior, we can add a helper method called choose to the PokerInterface class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choose method takes a list of button labels as a parameter, activates them, and them waits for the user to click one of them. The return value of the function is the label of the button that was clicked. We can call the choose method whenever we need input from the user. For example, if we are waiting for the user to choose either the \"Roll Dice\" or \"Quit\" button, we would use a sequence of code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "choice = self.choose([\"Roll Dice\", \"Quit\"])\n",
    "if choice == \"Roll Dice\":\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the buttons are stored in an instance variable called buttons, here is one possible implementation of choose:\n",
    "\n",
    "def choose(self, choices):\n",
    "    buttons = self.buttons\n",
    "    . # activate choice buttons, deactivate others for b \n",
    "    . # in buttons:\n",
    "    if b.getLabel() in choices:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b.activate()\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "    b.deactivate()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    .# get mouse clicks until an active button is        clicked\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "    p =self.win.getMouse()\n",
    "    for b in buttons:\n",
    "    if b.clicked(p):\n",
    "        return b.getLabel() # function exit here\n",
    "        \n",
    "The other widgets in our interface will be our DieView that we developed in the last two chapters. Basically, we will use the same class as before but we need to add just a bit of new functionality. As discussed above, we want to change the color of a die to indicate whether it is selected for rerolling.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to go back and review the DieView class. Remember, the class constructor draws a sqaure and seven circles to represent the positions where the pips of various values will appear. The setValue method turns on the appropriate pips to display a given value. To refresh your memory a bit, here is the setValue method as we left it:\n",
    "\n",
    "def setVaue(self, value):\n",
    ". # Turn all the pips off\n",
    "for pip in self.pips:\n",
    "pip.setFill(self.background)\n",
    "\n",
    ".# Turn the appropriate pips back on\n",
    "for i in self.onTable[value]:\n",
    "self.pips[i].setFill(self.foreground)\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to modify the DieView class by adding a setColor method. This method will be used to change the color that is used for drawing the pips. As you can see in the code for setVaue, the color of the pips is determined by the value of the instance variable foreground. Of course, changing the value of foreground will not actually change the appearance of the die until it is redrawn using the new color.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm for setColor seems straightforward. We need two steps:\n",
    "change foreground to the new color\n",
    "redraw the current value of the die.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the second step presents a slight snag. We already have code that draws a value, namely setValue. But setValue requires us to send the value as a paramter, and the current version of DieView does not store this value anywhere. Once the proper pips have been turned on, the actual value is discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement setColor, we need to tweak setValue so that it remembers the current vaue. The setColor can redraw the die using its current value. The change to setValue is easy; we just need to add a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "self.value = value\n",
    "\n",
    "This line stores the value parameter in an instance variable called value.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the modified version of setValue, implementing setColor is a breeze.\n",
    "\n",
    "def setColor(self, color):\n",
    "    self.foreground = color\n",
    "    self.setValue(self.value)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice how the last line simply calls setValue to (re)draw the die, passing along the value that was saved from the last time setValue was called.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "###### 12.4.1 Encapsulation\n",
    "The process of packaging some data along with the set of operations that can be performed on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a convenient way to compose comple solutions that correspons to our intuitive view ofhow the world works.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a design standpoint, encapsulation also provides a critical service of separatig the concerns of \"what\" vs. \"how\". The actual implementation of an object is independent of its use. The implementation can change but as long as the interface is preserved, other components that rely on the object will not break. This allows us to isolate major design decision, especially ones that are subject to change. \n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation also supports code reuse. It allows us to package up general components that can be use from one program to the next. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is probably the chief benefit of using objects but alone it only makes a system object-based. To be truly object oriented, the approach must also have the characteristics of polymorphism and inheritence.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 12.4.2 Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "means \"many forms. It refers to the fact that what an object does in response to a message(a method call) depends on the type or class of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our poker program illustrated one aspect of polymorphism. The PokerApp calss was used with both a TextInterface and a GraphicsInterface. There were two different forms of interface, and the PokerApp class could function quite well with either. When the PokerApp called the showDice method, for example, the TextInterface showed the dice one way and the GraphicsInterface did it another way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our poker example, we used either the text interface or the graphics interface. The remarkable thing about polymorphism, however, is that a given line in a program may invoke a completely different method from one moment to the next. As a simple example, suppose you had a list of graphics objects to draw on the screen. The list might contain a mixture of Circle, Rectangle, Polygon, etc. You could draw all the items in a list with this simple code:\n",
    "\n",
    "for obj in objects:\n",
    "    obj.draw(win)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now ask yourself, what operation does this loop actually execute? When obj is a circly, it executes the draw method from the circle class. When obj is a rectangle, it is the draw method from the rectangle class, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism gives object-oriented systems the flexibility for each object to perform an anction just the way that it should be performed for that object. Before object orientation, this kind of flexibility was much harder to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 12.4.3 Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "The third important propert for object-oriented approaches is one that we have not yet used. The idea is that a new class can be defined to borrow behavior from another class. The new class, the one doing the borrowing, is called a subclass and the existing class, the one being borrowed from is its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we are building a system to keep track of employees, we might have a class\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee that contains the general information that is common to all employees. One example attribute would be a homeAddress method that returns the home address of an employee. Within the class of all employees, we might distinguish between SalariedEmployee and HourlyEmployee. We could make these subclasses of Employee so they would share methods like homeAddress. However, each subclass would have its own monthlyPay function, since pay is computed differently for these different classes of employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritence provides two benefits. One is that we can structure the classes of a system to avoid duplication of operations. We don't have to write a separate homeAddress method for the HourlyEmployee and SalariedEmployee classes. A closely related benefit is that new classes can often be based on existing classes, promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have used inheritance to build our poker program. Wehn we first wrote the DieVeiw clss, it did not provide a way of changing the appearance of the die. We solved this problem by modifying the original class definition. An alternative would have been to leave the original class unchanged and create a new subclass ColorDieView. A ColorDieView is just like a DieView except that it contains an additional method that allows us to change its color.\n",
